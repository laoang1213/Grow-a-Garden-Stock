## About This Project

This repository hosts the open-source resources and documentation for **Grow a Garden Stock**, a lightweight web app that monitors every shop in Roblox’s *Grow a Garden* and displays:

* **Live inventory** for Seed, Gear, Egg, and limited-time Event shops
* **Countdown timers** until the next restock
* **Rarity highlights** so ultra-rare items stand out instantly
* **Mobile-friendly one-page layout**—no ads, no login, just data

The goal is simple: give farmers and flippers the same “instant quote” power that stock traders have, so you can buy low, sell high, and stop wasting hours on server-hopping.

## What Is *Grow a Garden*?

*Grow a Garden* is a farming-simulation game on Roblox where players:

1. **Plant & Harvest** — Raise crops that range from Common Carrots to Divine Dragonfruit.
2. **Upgrade Gear** — Unlock sprinklers, fertilizers, and harvesting scythes to boost yields.
3. **Trade & Profit** — Sell produce to NPCs or flip rare items in the player market.
4. **Join Events** — Grab exclusive seeds, pets, and cosmetics during Blood Moon, Twilight, and holiday events.

Because shop inventories refresh every few minutes, grabbing a Legendary Seed the moment it appears can be the difference between pocket change and a fortune.

## Stock Categories & Refresh Timers

| Shop            | Typical Refresh | Sample Items                        |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Seed Shop**   | 5 min           | Rainbow Mango Seed, Mutation Seed   |
| **Gear Shop**   | 5 min           | Golden Watering Can, Harvest Scythe |
| **Egg Shop**    | 10 min          | Mythic Pet Egg, Seasonal Egg        |
| **Event Shops** | Varies          | Blood Moon Seeds, Holiday Cosmetics |

> **Pro Tip:** Lower-population servers give you a one-to-two-second head start once you know the exact restock moment.

## Why Track Stock?

* **Beat the Crowd** – See a Divine Seed 10 seconds before it spawns, jump into a quiet server, buy it first.
* **Maximize Flip Profits** – Rare items often resell for 3–20× the shop price.
* **Save Time** – One browser tab replaces hours of manual refreshes and server hopping.
* **Never Miss Events** – Countdown timers cover Blood Moon, Twilight Shop, and special holidays.

4. Optional: Combine the site with Discord ping bots or browser notifications for near-perfect coverage.
